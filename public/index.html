        Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tag above.
        It will be replaced with the URL of the 'public' folder during the build.
        Only the files inside the 'public' folder can be referenced from the HTML.
        
        Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", %PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
        work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
        Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running 'npm run build'.
